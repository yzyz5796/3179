        <h1>Household Income and Poverty in Malaysia</h1> <!-- Title -->
        <p>In Malaysia, household income and poverty are vital indicators of economic well-being and social progress. The uneven distribution of wealth, regional disparities, and varying economic opportunities across states significantly impact the standard of living for millions of Malaysians. To better understand these dynamics, I have created several visualizations that explore income levels, poverty rates, and expenditure patterns across the country, aiming to uncover correlations between these factors and highlight areas requiring policy attention for more equitable development.</p>

          <p>The map above shows the median household income by state in Malaysia for the year 2022. States with higher median incomes are represented by darker shades. We can observe that concentration of wealth is  in more urbanized regions such as states like Selangor, Kuala Lumpur, and Putrajaya which have the highest median incomes. In contrast, states like Kelantan and Perlis have significantly lower median incomes, reflecting regional economic disparities. This visualization helps identify disparities in income distribution across different regions.</p>

          <h2>Income & Poverty Insights</h2>
          <p>From the visualizations, we can observe the distribution of household income and poverty rates across various states in Malaysia.
            Sabah and Kelantan have the highest poverty rates, with over 15% of the population living below the poverty line.  There is a correlation between income, expenditure and poverty, as states with lower median incomes, such as Sabah and Kelantan, also show lower levels of average household spending and high poverty rate.
             This indicates that poorer regions tend to have lower living costs but also less disposable income.
            These insights can help policy makers address inequalities and identify areas that need the most attention. </p>

            <h2>Median Income Trend</h2>
            <p>
              The line graph on beside shows the changes in median income across various states in Malaysia from 1970 to 2022.
              From the graph, we can observe a general upward trend in median income over time for all states, indicating economic growth.
              More urbanized states like Selangor, Kuala Lumpur, and Putrajaya show a steeper increase in median income, especially in recent years, while rural states like Kelantan and Perlis show a slower pace of income growth, highlighting regional income disparities.
              The gap between high-income and low-income states appears to be widening over time, reflecting uneven economic development across the country.

            <h3>Analysis of Bubble Plot</h3>
            <p>
                The bubble plot illustrates the relationship between the mean and median income for various states across multiple years.
                Each bubble represents a state, with larger bubbles indicating higher income levels. The bubbles' positions along the x-axis represent time (years), and the y-axis shows the mean income.
                States with higher median incomes, such as Selangor and Putrajaya, are clustered at the upper end of the graph, indicating better economic performance.
                The growth of these bubbles over time suggests that the disparity between wealthier and less affluent regions is increasing.
